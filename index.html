      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Arnold Schwarzenegger is an Austrian-American actor, politician, and
        former professional bodybuilder. He was born on July 30, 1947, in Thal,
        Austria.
      </p>
      <p>
        Schwarzenegger began weight training at a young age and excelled in
        bodybuilding competitions. He won the Mr. Universe title at age 20 and
        went on to win the Mr. Olympia contest seven times, establishing himself
        as one of the greatest bodybuilders of all time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the 1980s, Schwarzenegger transitioned to acting and quickly became a
        Hollywood superstar. He starred in blockbuster films such as "The
        Terminator," "Predator," and "Total Recall," solidifying his status as
        an action movie icon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond his successful acting career, Schwarzenegger ventured into
        politics and served as the Governor of California from 2003 to 2011.
        During his tenure, he focused on issues such as environmental
        protection, infrastructure development, and economic reform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Schwarzenegger is also known for his philanthropic work, particularly in
        the areas of children's health and fitness education. He founded the
        Arnold Sports Festival, an annual multi-sport event, and has been
        actively involved in various charitable organizations.

      <h2 dir="rtl">פרטו שלושה הבדלים עיקריים בין web1, web2 ו web3</h2>
      <div class="answer">
        <h3>User Interaction</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Web 1.0:</strong> Read-only, static web pages with content
          created by website owners/publishers. Very little user interaction.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Web 2.0:</strong> Read-write web with user-generated content,
          social media, blogs, wikis, etc. Enabled participatory and interactive
          web. <br /><br />
          <strong>Web 3.0:</strong> Read-write-execute web focused on
          integrating data from different sources using semantic technologies.
          Aimed for intelligent content understanding by machines.
        </p>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Web 1.0:</strong> Focus was on making information and content
          available online for people to access and read. Companies published
          content for users to consume. <br /><br />
          <strong>Web 2.0:</strong> Focus shifted to facilitating communication,
          sharing, and user-generated content creation. Companies built
          platforms that enabled users to publish content for others.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Web 3.0:</strong> Integration and connection of data from
          different sources to provide more intelligent searching, processing,
          and analysis capabilities. Move towards a web of knowledge and data
          rather than just documents.
        </p>

        <h3>Technologies</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Web 1.0:</strong> Used basic HTML for creating static web
          pages. <br /><br />
          <strong>Web 2.0:</strong> Introduced technologies like XML, RSS feeds,
          AJAX for more interactive and dynamic web applications. <br /><br />
          <strong>Web 3.0:</strong> Utilizes formats like RDF (Resource
          Description Framework) and OWL (Web Ontology Language) to represent
          data in a machine-readable way to enable better integration,
          searching, and inferencing.

          הסבירו את ההבדלים שצוינו בשאלה 1 על ידי דוגמה של תרחיש שימוש (use
          case)
        </h2>

        Let's consider searching for information on "best restaurants in a Tel
        Aviv" across the different web generations:
        <br />
        <article>
          <strong>Web 1.0:</strong> One-way, static information In Web 1.0,
          searching for "best restaurants in Tel Aviv" would lead you to static
          websites with information created and published by the website
          owners/editors. The content would be text-based, likely just listing
          some popular restaurants with basic details like cuisine, address etc.
          There would be no way for users to contribute reviews, ratings or
          additional content. <br /><strong>Web 2.0:</strong>the same search
          would return much richer results by tapping into user-generated
          content. You would find reviews, ratings and photos of restaurants
          posted by costumers. Food blogs would have detailed accounts of dining
          experiences. Social media could reveal what restaurants your friends
          recommend. The ability for users to create and share content leads to
          a collaborative knowledgebase.<br /><strong>Web 3.0:</strong>For "best
          restaurants in Tel Aviv", it could integrate data from review sites,
          social media, restaurant databases and present a unified, rationalized
          view highlighting the most relevant restaurants based on your
          preferences, budgets, dietary restrictions etc. By representing data
          in machine-readable formats, Web 3.0 allows more automated reasoning
          over vast distributed data. So in summary, Web 1.0 was one-way
          publisher->consumer, Web 2.0 enabled collaboration via user-generated
          content, while Web 3.0 envisions intelligent connectivity of data from
          different sources.
